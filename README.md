## Notes on using Jeykll on Github Pages

The [website](https://blockstream.github.io/docs) uses [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to serve its content using the files within this repository.

Github Pages itself uses [Jeykyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static website content from simple "markdown" formatted files. Making changes to pages on the blockstream.github.io/docs site is as easy as editing one of this repository's ".md" files. Accepted changes will be automatically built and served to the website.
