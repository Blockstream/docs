<p>The Blockstream Satellite serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Continuous broadcast of the Bitcoin blockchain 24/7 from space:</strong> allows anyone to gain access to the Bitcoin network regardless of their internet connection.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom data broadcasts:</strong> Users and developers can also send their own data over the network via the Blockstream Satellite API.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone within Blockstream Satelliteâ€™s coverage areas (see below) can receive the data transmitted over the network</p>
