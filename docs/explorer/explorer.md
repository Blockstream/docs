# Welcome to the Blockstream Explorer Docs

![The Blockstream Explorer](https://nwoodfine.github.io/blockstream-docs/docs/assets/blockstream_explorer.png)

[Blockstream Explorer](//blockstream.info) is a performance and privacy-focused block explorer that supports Bitcoin mainnet, Bitcoin testnet, and the Liquid Network. Regular users can obtain comprehensive blockchain data from the [web interface](//blockstream.info), and developers can add blockchain support to their apps via the fully-featured API.

## Key Features of the Explorer:
- **High-performance:** Blockstream Explorer has been carefully engineered to be as light as possible, with as much work outsourced to the browser as possible. It's simply the fastest block explorer out there.
- **No Tracking:** You won't find any Google Analytics or other tracking software on the site, which could compromise your privacy.
- **Tor Support:** Onion endpoints are available for Tor users.
- **No JavaScript:** To further enhance privacy, Blockstream Explorer offers a support for users with JavaScript switched off.
- **Broadcast Transactions:** You can broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network right from within the explorer.
- **QR Code Scanner:** Scan a public key in your web browser to quickly look up information on a Bitcoin address.
- **Liquid Support:** Monitor [peg-in](https://blockstream.info/liquid/tx/09b5179b2e8b8f0e15e47bf07a35aa50bf8792bfa7ec415a3362b42864dd7a44) and [peg-outs](https://blockstream.info/liquid/tx/ee89b9c9ce9573618d6d82c7c03ce241ee1199f76f5e30c8663d05c5c7c7cd45) between Bitcoin and Liquid and support for [Confidential addresses](https://blockstream.info/liquid/tx/bc615100d80e55b1167d907d3ce2e5480f942b7c220ec1d62c71f175a36feaa1)
