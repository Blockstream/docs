# Hardware Wallets (Android)

Blockstream Green has full functionality built-in for hardware wallets. This gets you the best of both worlds by granting you access to Blockstream Green multisig security and features, while using your hardware wallet to safely store your own private key.

Currently, we support compatibility with Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. You can see detailed instructions how to use each type below.
