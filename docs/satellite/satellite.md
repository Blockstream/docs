# Satellite Docs

The Blockstream Satellite serves two purposes:
1. **Continuous broadcast of the Bitcoin blockchain 24/7 from space:** allows anyone to gain access to the Bitcoin network regardless of their internet connection.
2. **Custom data broadcasts:** Users and developers can also send their own data over the network via the Blockstream Satellite API.

Anyone within Blockstream Satellite's coverage areas (see below) can receive the data transmitted over the network
