Support
=======

If you have questions not answered in this guide, there are several different ways to
reach us.

.. attention:: **Blockstream Green support will never ask you for your mnemonic or seed.**
   If someone asks you to provide your mnemonic, they do not work for Blockstream, and are
   likely trying to scam you.

For any bug or issue you can directly contact us through our support email: 
info@greenaddress.it

Please include as much detail as possible. The more information you provide, the faster we
will be able to assist you. In particular, please let us know:

1. A short description of the problem and the expected behavior
2. The date and time when you noticed or reproduced the issue
3. Which client you are using (Desktop, iOS, Android) with its version number
4. Your operating system and version number
5. Any Transaction Hashes and/or addresses relevant to the problem
6. To identify your wallet in our database, at least one of your:

   - 2FA email address
   - 2FA SMS number
   - `Watch-only login username`_

7. The exact text of any error message and/or a screenshot/video of the problem (we only
   open .jpg images for security purposes)
8. Any further information that you think is relevant to the problem.

You can also ask questions publicly on our telegram_ chat, or by reaching out to
`\@BlockstreamHelp`_ on Twitter. On these public channels, other users sometimes answer
questions, so keep in mind that official responses will only be from the Telegram group
admins, or directly answered by @BlockstreamHelp on Twitter.
