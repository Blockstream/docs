=======

If you have questions not answered in this guide, there are several different ways to
reach us.

.. attention:: **Blockstream Green support will never ask you for your mnemonic or seed**.

Many users ask questions publicly on our telegram_ chat, citing `\@BlockstreamHelp`_ on
Twitter, or at our subreddit_ so you might find your question already answered over there.
Other reddit users sometimes answer questions, so keep in mind that official responses
will only be from moderators of the subreddit (visible on the sidebar), from the Telegram
group admins, or directly answered by @BlockstreamHelp on Twitter.
