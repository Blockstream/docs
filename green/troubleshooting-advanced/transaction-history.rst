Understanding and Using Transaction History Data
------------------------------------------------

After you log in to your wallet, the default page displayed will include a list of your
wallet's transaction activity, directly below the send and receive buttons. This displays,
in order from newest to oldest, a history of all transactions that have entered and left
your wallet.

This is where you come if you want to check on a recent transaction’s confirmation status,
or if you suspect there has been suspicious activity and want to see if any coins have
left your wallet.

From the main page, you’ll be able to see the date of the transaction, the other recipient
or sender’s address, and the amount displayed in BTC.

You can also click on any one of the transactions to see extra detailed information about
it. The most common reason to do this is to get a Transaction ID or TXID. This is also
known as a Transaction Hash, and can be shown to other people as a proof-of-payment, since
it allows them to find and verify the transaction for themselves.

Aside from the TXID, there is much more useful information, especially for more advanced
users. This includes the precise date and time and the fees paid to the miners.

If you need more information, you can click on the "View in Explorer" button. This will
take you to our `block explorer`_, which will display your transaction in even more detail
.

You can also add, remove, or edit a memo for that transaction.
