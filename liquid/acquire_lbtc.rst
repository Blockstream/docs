How to Peg-In Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) with Elements Core
-------------------------------------------------------

This guide requires a moderate level of technical proficiency. Some
users may prefer to go use one of the exchange methods for a more
convenient solution.

.. Warning:: L-BTC peg-outs must be performed via a Liquid Member, e.g. Bitfinex. Don’t peg-in L-BTC unless you are sure you have a method of converting them back to BTC.

|image2|

1.  `Download and install Bitcoin Core`_ (use `Node Launcher`_ for fast
    setup).

2.  Run and sync your Bitcoin node (could take a day or more).

3.  Follow the :ref:`Liquid Quickstart Guide <quickstart>`.

4.  :ref:`Enable peg-in validation <quickstart_pegin>`.

5.  Run and sync your Liquid node.

6.  In the Elements Core client, open the console window by clicking
    Help/Debug Window -> Console tab.

7.  In the console, get a peg-in address using the following command.
    ``getpeginaddress``

8.  Save the **mainchain_address** and **claim_script** values for use
    later.

9.  Send Bitcoin to the **mainchain_address** and keep a copy of the
    transaction id returned.

10. Wait for 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin chain, which will take on
    average around 17 hours with a sufficient Bitcoin miner fee. You can
    track your transaction’s progress on `Blockstream Explorer`_.

11. Once the transaction has received 102 confirmations, go to your
    Bitcoin Core client, and open the console by clicking Help/Debug
    Window -> Console tab.

12. Enter the following two commands and record the results, you will
    need them to claim the peg-in on Liquid.

    ::

       getrawtransaction <yourTXID>

    ::

       gettxoutproof '["'<yourTXID>'"]'

13. Go back to the Elements Core client and open the console window as before. Enter the
    following command, using the result from
    ``getrawtransaction <yourTXID>`` as ``<raw>`` and the result from
    ``gettxoutproof '["'<yourTXID>'"]'`` as ``<proof>``.

    ::

       claimpegin <raw> <proof> <claim_script>

14. The claim transaction should confirm in around two minutes. Once
    confirmed, you should see your L-BTC balance updated in your Liquid
    Core client.

Congratulations! You’re now the proud owner of some Liquid Bitcoin. These can be transferred to other Liquid users, exchanges and other businesses that support Liquid, or used to cover the transaction fee when creating and transferring Issued Assets.
