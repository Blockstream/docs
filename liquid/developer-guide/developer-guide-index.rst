Developer Guide
===============

The code examples listed below show you how to make use of the most common features of Liquid. Each example uses the command line and the Liquid Client application (elements-cli) to issue commands to either the Liquid daemon (elementsd) or Liquid Core GUI (elements-qt), depending on which you are running. 

The example code can be modified to work in other languages like Python, C#, Ruby, Go, Perl, and Java by following the steps in the :ref:`App Examples <liquid-app-examples>` section and issuing the appropriate RPC commands to Liquid using your chosen language instead of via elements-cli.

It is also worth noting that any examples on the `Elements website`_ will also work on Liquid, as Liquid is built using the Elements codebase. The Elements website also includes instructions on how to run all the basic_ and more advanced_ code examples listed here (and more) from within one file, that you can copy and paste and run from the terminal.
