Proof of Issuance - Blockstream's Liquid Asset Registry
-------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to use Blockstream's `Liquid Asset Registry`_. The asset registry allows you to register an asset and prove ownership against a domain name. 

The code below creates an asset, an associated token, and outputs two files:

* A 'liquid-asset-proof-' file that must be placed on the server of the registered domain over the entire lifecycle of the asset.

* A 'register_asset.sh' file that, when run, will post the asset registration data to Blockstream's Liquid Asset Registry.

The use of the output files will be explained later.

There are six fields that need setting within the script:

* ``NAME`` The name of the asset as it will apear in the registry and applications that use asset registry data, such as the `Blockstream Explorer`_. Length must be 5 to 255 ascii characters.

* ``TICKER`` The ticker you would like to assign to the asset. Length must be 3 to 5 characters (valid characters are a-z and A-Z).

* ``DOMAIN`` The domain that will be used to verify the asset. Must be a valid domain name format, for example: example.com or sub.example.com. Do not include the http/s or www prefixes.

* ``ASSET_AMOUNT`` The amount to be issued. It is preferable to consider one satoshi unit as representing one asset. So to issue an amount of 100 of an asset, a value of 0.00000100 should be used. Please note that how this value is displayed within applications that use asset registry data is affected by the ``PRECISION`` field. 

* ``TOKEN_AMOUNT`` The amount of reissuance tokens to be created. It is preferable to consider one satoshi unit as representing one reissuance token, so a value of 0.00000001 will create 0.00000001 reissuance tokens and when viewed from Liquid Core it will also show as 0.00000001. When viewed from an app that uses satoshi sized units, such as the `Blockstream Explorer`_ it will show as 1. This field is not affected by the ``PRECISION`` field.

* ``PRECISION`` The precision used to display the asset amount within applications that use `Liquid Asset Registry`_ data, such as the `Blockstream Explorer`_. Examples: a ``PRECISION`` value of 0 for an ``ASSET_AMOUNT`` of 0.00000100 will create a value of 0.00000100 when viewed from Liquid Core and 100 when viewed in an app that uses the asset registry data. A ``PRECISION`` value of 2 for an ``ASSET_AMOUNT`` of 0.00000100 will create a value of 0.00000100 when viewed from Liquid Core and 1.00 when viewed in the same app. The default is 0 and the maximum value is 8.

The code below uses Liquid in live mode. The code can easily be adapted for test use.

Save the code below in a file named issue_and_prepare_register.sh

When you have saved the above to the file, edit the variables at the top and of the file and start elements-qt or elementsd using an argument of ``-server=1`` to allow the Liquid client to communicate with it. Execute the script from the directory you created it in by opening a Terminal session and running:

.. code-block:: bash

	bash issue_and_prepare_register.sh

In order to register the asset just created:

* Wait a couple of minutes for the issuance transaction to confirm.

* Place the 'liquid-asset-proof-' file in a folder named '.well-known' in the root of your domain. **This proof should be stored there over the entire lifecycle of the asset.**

* Run the 'register_asset.sh' script. 

For example, if your domain was www.your-example-domain-here.com and the asset id generated was 123abc (it will of course be much longer) then the file generated would be named:

.. code-block:: text

	liquid-asset-proof-123abc

The domain variable in the code above would be set to:

.. code-block:: text

	your-example-domain-here.com

So the path used to check asset to domain registry would end up being: 

.. code-block:: text

	www.your-example-domain-here.com/.well-known/liquid-asset-proof-123abc

Once that file is accessible you can then run the 'register_asset.sh' script and, when the required checks against the domain and issuance transaction have been made, the registration will be found on Blockstream's `Liquid Asset Registry`_.
